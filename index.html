            <p>Hi!  Welcome to my very first portfolio displaying my progress as a coder.  I am currently a student at the UMN Coding Boot Camp, and I am hoping to learn lots about creating websites, web applications and possibly mobile applications.  I originally obtained a bachelor's of science in psychology from the University of Minnesota.  I am currently working at Fairview Hospital in Minneapolis as a Psychiatric Associate in a mental health unit with children/adolescents.</p>
            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Running (I am training for the Twin Cities Marathon.)</li>
                <li>Playing Card Games of all sorts</li>
                <li>Kayaking</li>
                <li>Walking with Dogs</li>
                <li>Playing Video Games</li>
                <li>And now, coding things!</li>
            </ul>
